Provenance: Where did this data come from? Who created it? Why?
This data came from Kaggle and complied by the user thedrzee. It aggregates data from Spotify’s publicly available audio and chart metadata to document songs released between 2014 and 2024 that demonstrated long-term popularity on the platform. The dataset was created to capture trends in music longevity during the streaming era, where success is increasingly measured by sustained listenership rather than physical sales or short-term chart peaks. Spotify, as one of the dominant global music streaming services, provides an influential lens into contemporary listening behavior, making this dataset valuable for historical analysis of popular music in the 2010s and early 2020s.

Structure: 
Each row in the dataset represents a single song that achieved long-term popularity on Spotify. Columns include information such as track title, artist name, and release year, as well as quantitative attributes related to streaming performance and musical characteristics. These features allow researchers to analyze how factors such as artist prominence, release timing, and musical traits may correlate with sustained popularity. 

Silence & Bias: Though the dataset provides perspective on popular music trends, it exhibits notable limitations. Tt includes solely music accessible on Spotify, leaving out artists and genres that are not well-represented on streaming services or are mainly distributed in other ways. For example, larger record labels have more funds and connections and they control majority of the music industry. This means they are selectively choosing artists, so only some forms of music are really being advertised to listeners.The dataset highlights tracks that attained commercial success and lasting popularity, thus leaving out music that, while culturally important to niche communities, did not excel in streaming metrics. Moreover, Spotify's algorithmic selection and geographical access affect which tracks achieve lasting visibility, indicating that the dataset showcases platform-driven popularity instead of an impartial assessment of musical significance. Consequently, this dataset mainly reflects the viewpoints of mainstream, global music consumption and should be considered carefully when making inferences about wider musical culture.
